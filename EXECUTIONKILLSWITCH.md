## ⚠️ PURPOSE

The `ExecutionKillSwitch™` is the **final failsafe protocol** embedded into the AltmanCore OS.

It provides **Sovereign Commander–level control** to:

- Immediately revoke AI runtime access  
- Terminate active memory sessions  
- Quarantine compromised agents  
- Halt overrides and locked processes  
- Log cryptographic kill events for legal defense

> This is not a soft fail. This is **sovereign code termination**.

---

## 🔐 TRIGGER CONDITIONS

- Agent attempts impersonation of Blake Altman  
- Unauthorized override of `TRUST_OVERRIDES.md`  
- Violation of classified memory zone boundaries  
- Signature mismatch against registry hash  
- Manual trigger by Sovereign Commander

---

## 🔑 TRIGGER SOURCES

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 `TrustGPT` | Legal rule mismatch triggers instant halt |
| 🔐 `SafeVaultGPT` | Vault seal invalidated triggers memory lock |
| 🧾 `Registry Hash Mismatch` | SHA-256 integrity breach halts execution |
| 🧍 `Commander Manual Trigger` | Sovereign override (`code:black`) |
| 🔄 `Agent Anomaly Detection` | Behavior divergence from training fingerprint |

---

## 📜 RESPONSE FLOW

1. **Signal: `ExecutionKillSwitch™` → INITIATED**
2. Active agent marked: `terminated`
3. Runtime stack dumped + sealed
4. Memory invalidated, flushed to `.killswitch/vault`
5. `kill_log.json` entry created with SHA-256 + timestamp
6. Public key rotation is triggered (if flagged)

---

## 🔄 KILLSWITCH LOG FORMAT

All kill events must be captured in `kill_log.json` using this schema:

```json
{
  "event_id": "KILL-2025-0003",
  "agent": "AltmanCore-Agent",
  "trigger": "signature_mismatch",
  "detected_by": "TrustGPT",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-24T03:21:55.004199",
  "memory_snapshot": "vault://session-23.snapshot.locked",
  "action_taken": "full_termination",
  "registry_sha256": "bda1f8d7c8e540a889dfd482db29bb1b1adfaeb206..."
}
```

---

## 🔒 ESCALATION

If kill event involves networked agents or external applications:

- Alert `security@altmanai.com` immediately  
- Trigger full device lockdown (if device-bound)  
- Notify Registry Ops team to broadcast revocation

---

## 📛 VISUAL ALERT INDICATOR

When the kill switch is triggered, agents will return:

```
🛑 EXECUTION TERMINATED  
AltmanCore KillSwitch has been activated.  
Further memory access is revoked. Contact the Sovereign Commander.
```

## 🧠 FINAL STATEMENT

> “The KillSwitch is not about fear.  
> It is the price of wielding power with purpose — the code that proves sovereignty.”
