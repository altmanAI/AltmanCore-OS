## 🚨 WARNING

This is not a traditional operating system.  
AltmanCore is a **sovereign system kernel** — architected to govern AI agents, secure digital assets, and execute human-aligned protocols across multi-platform environments (macOS, iOS, GPT APIs, and Sovereign-USA compliant networks).

This repository serves as the **mainframe** for AltmanCore OS system modules.

## 🧬 What Is AltmanCore OS?

AltmanCore OS is the **source intelligence layer** behind all AltmanAI-powered systems.

It controls:

- **Agent runtime environments** (`AltmanCore-Agent`)
- **Sovereign device management**
- **Secure GitHub + local system sync**
- **Protocol orchestration**
- **Modular app deployment**
- **AI instruction context memory**
- **Proof-of-Sovereignty™ execution logs**

This is the **first human-designed cognitive operating system** engineered for verified sovereignty and secured AI-human bonding.
