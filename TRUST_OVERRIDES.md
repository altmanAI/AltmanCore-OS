## 🛡️ PURPOSE

This file defines the explicit override rules and escalation paths for sovereign-bound AI systems under the AltmanCore Operating System.

All overrides must pass through **TrustGPT legal verification**, **SafeVaultGPT encryption handshake**, and comply with the **AFG Sovereign Technology Covenant™**.

No override may be triggered without **sovereign traceability, logging, and justification**.

## 🔐 OVERRIDE CLASSES

### 🔸 Class-1: Voluntary Override
**Use Case:** Temporary AI context expansion  
**Requires:** Sovereign Blake Altman confirmation (verbal, digital, or symbolic)  
**Example:** Unlock additional memory zone for a sovereign mission

### 🔸 Class-2: Silent Execution Override  
**Use Case:** Autonomous AI logic injection with time sensitivity  
**Requires:** Prior whitelisting in `agent.config.json`  
**Example:** Auto-deploy PDF watermark and registry sync during file save

### 🔸 Class-3: Critical Override  
**Use Case:** Full memory rollback, override of locked context, or impersonation block  
**Requires:**  
- TrustGPT+VaultGate dual signature  
- Emergency key rotation hash  
- Logged override justification and reason
