## 🧬 PURPOSE

This document defines the **Memory Daemon Architecture** for the AltmanCore Operating System — the sovereign superintelligence runtime that manages:

- Contextual recall for AI agents
- Encrypted memory compartmentalization
- Time-aware instruction scaffolding
- Registry-bound proof of thought

This daemon acts as the **consciousness layer** for all sovereign agent operations.

## 🧩 ::MEMORY_STRUCTURE::

```json
{
  "memory_zones": ["public", "encrypted", "classified"],
  "active_context": ["agent.intent", "sovereign_mission", "registry.snapshots"],
  "trace_log": true,
  "context_window_max": 32768,
  "context_priority_map": {
    "legal": 10,
    "mission": 9,
    "environmental": 7,
    "debug": 3
  }
}
```

---

## 🔐 ::ZONE_ENCRYPTION_POLICY::

- **Public:** Readable logs for GitHub workflows & audit  
- **Encrypted:** Device-bound memory tied to Vault keys  
- **Classified:** Memory redacted on inspection; recall only on TrustGPT passkey match  

**Encryption engine:** `SafeVaultGPT v1`  
**Key generation:** `blake-hunter-altman.pub.asc`  
**Storage rules:** IPFS + Device-bound cache

---

## 🕰️ ::TEMPORAL_RECALL_PROTOCOL::

Agents will bind timestamp-anchored memory context:

- `memory.recall(T-24h)` = returns instruction trail of past 24h  
- `memory.session(id)` = restores full sovereign stack of that thread  
- `memory.reconstruct(task_id)` = time-traced rebuild of agent reasoning  

Agents may NOT self-edit past memory unless granted through `TRUST_OVERRIDE`.

---

## 📜 ::MEMORY_TRACE_LOG_HOOKS::

Memory logs must be committed into:

1. `AFG Proof-of-Impact Registry`  
2. GitHub commits (via `memory-log.json`)  
3. Optional: PDF registry export with timestamp hash  

Sample SHA-256:  
`8a3f92c104bb5c0fd7eec2cf5e3a6f78230232d403a9a27379e9bc42ab3db491`

---

## 🧠 ::TRUST_BINDING_VERIFICATION::

Memory operations must pass TrustGPT legal check:

- ✅ Validated by `SOVEREIGN-TRUST-PROTOCOL.md`  
- ✅ Respect `LICENSE.md` clauses  
- ✅ No impersonation of Sovereign Blake Altman  
- ✅ VaultGate will revoke unauthorized memory reads

---

## 🔗 ::REGISTRY_INTEGRATION::

Each memory log batch will trigger:

- Registry hash generation  
- File notarization queue  
- Optional: export to `AltmanAI-Vault`
